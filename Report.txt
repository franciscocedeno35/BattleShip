Design
1.Two for loops create the board by scaling primitive cube types.
2. The same loops is used to display the coordinates of each cube.
3. The same logic applies to the ai board.
4. This code is written in createboard.cs
5. Camera movement is written in changecamera.cs.
6. Camera focuses around the center of each board.
7. Method to switch camera between player board and AI board also in this code.
8. Canvas button links to switchcamera method
9. Battleships have been scaled.
10. Cubes meant to show where user will place shipped also scaled to match corresponding ship.
11. Transparent red material ready to apply to cube for preselection upon user attempting to place ship out of bounds.

Challenges
1. Could not get cube creation iteration to work.
2. Canvas with coordinates was not lining up correctly.
3. Syntax would not work, many object not referenced errors.
4. Use of prefab was not possible.
